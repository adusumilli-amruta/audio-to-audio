# Audio to Audio Converter

This project is a web application that converts audio from one language to another. Users can upload an audio file in one language, select the target language, and click "Convert" to generate a new audio file in the selected language. The application is built using Next.js for the frontend and Transformers.js for the backend processing.

## Introduction

The Audio to Audio Converter is designed to help users translate audio files from one language to another. This tool is particularly useful for language learning, content translation, and accessibility purposes.

## Proposed Ideas

1. **Multilingual Audio Translation**: Convert audio files from one language to another while maintaining the original speaker's voice characteristics.
2. **User-Friendly Interface**: Develop an intuitive interface for easy audio upload and language selection.
3. **High-Quality Output**: Ensure the translated audio is clear and natural-sounding using advanced NLP models.
4. **Scalability and Performance**: Optimize the application to handle multiple requests efficiently.

## Major Steps

1. **Set Up Next.js Project**: Initialize the Next.js framework to build the web application.
2. **Integrate Transformers.js**: Use Transformers.js for the audio translation process.
3. **Develop Frontend Components**: Create components for audio file upload, language selection, and displaying the translated audio.
4. **Implement Backend Logic**: Handle audio processing and language translation, and manage the conversion process.
5. **Testing and Debugging**: Ensure the application works correctly and efficiently through rigorous testing.

## Techniques

### NLP Models and Transformers.js

- **Speech Recognition and Synthesis**: Utilize models like Wav2Vec for speech recognition and Tacotron2 or WaveNet for speech synthesis.
- **Language Translation**: Implement models such as MarianMT for translating the transcribed text from the source language to the target language.
- **Voice Cloning**: Use advanced techniques to maintain the original speaker's voice characteristics in the translated audio.

### Frontend Development with Next.js

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Enhance performance and SEO using SSR.
- **Interactive UI Components**: Build responsive and user-friendly components for file upload, language selection, and output display.
- **State Management**: Efficiently manage the state of uploaded audio, selected languages, and conversion results.

## Evaluations

1. **Accuracy of Translation**: Assess the correctness and coherence of the translated audio.
2. **Audio Quality**: Evaluate the clarity and naturalness of the synthesized speech.
3. **Performance Metrics**: Measure the application's response time and its ability to handle concurrent requests.
4. **User Feedback**: Collect feedback to improve the interface and functionality.
5. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to manage issues such as unsupported file formats or languages.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adusumilli-amruta/audio-to-audio.git
   cd audio-to-audio
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
