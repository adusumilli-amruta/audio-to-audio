# Audio to Audio Converter

This project is a web application that converts audio files from one language to another. Users can upload an audio file in one language, select the target language, and click "Convert" to generate a new audio file in the selected language. The application is built using Next.js for the frontend and Transformers.js for the backend processing.

## Introduction

The Audio to Audio Converter simplifies the process of translating spoken language by converting audio files from one language to another. This tool is particularly useful for multilingual communication, accessibility, and language learning.

## Proposed Ideas

1. **Multilingual Audio Conversion**: Support conversion between various languages to cater to a global audience.
2. **High-Quality Audio Output**: Ensure the generated audio is clear and natural-sounding.
3. **User-Friendly Interface**: Develop an intuitive interface for easy audio file upload and language selection.
4. **Real-Time Processing**: Implement real-time conversion capabilities for instantaneous results.

## Major Steps

1. **Set Up Next.js Project**: Initialize the Next.js framework to build the web application.
2. **Integrate Transformers.js**: Use Transformers.js for audio processing and language translation.
3. **Develop Frontend Components**: Create input forms for audio file upload and dropdown menus for language selection.
4. **Implement Backend Logic**: Handle audio processing, language translation, and audio synthesis.
5. **Testing and Debugging**: Ensure the application works correctly and efficiently through rigorous testing.

## Techniques

### NLP Models and Transformers.js

- **Transformer Models**: Utilizing models like Wav2Vec for speech recognition and Tacotron2 for speech synthesis.
- **Audio Tokenization**: Converting audio into tokens and embeddings suitable for processing by transformer models.
- **Translation Pipeline**: Using pre-trained models and fine-tuning them for the specific task of audio translation.

### Frontend Development with Next.js

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Enhancing performance and SEO using SSR.
- **Interactive UI Components**: Building responsive and user-friendly components for audio upload, language selection, and audio playback.
- **State Management**: Efficiently managing the state of uploaded audio, selected languages, and conversion results.

## Evaluations

1. **Audio Quality**: Assessing the clarity, naturalness, and accuracy of the converted audio.
2. **Performance Metrics**: Measuring the application's response time and its ability to handle multiple requests.
3. **User Feedback**: Collecting feedback to improve the interface and functionality.
4. **Error Handling**: Implementing robust error handling to manage issues such as unsupported audio formats or languages.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adusumilli-amruta/audio-to-audio.git
   cd audio-to-audio
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:
